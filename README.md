This GitHub repository includes the data (as well as the associated metadata and R scripts) used for the Ocean Health Index calculations for the following assessments: 
* Global (EEZ regions, "globalprep folder") 
* Antarctica (EEZ and high seas regions) 
* High Seas (FAO regions minus the EEZ regions)

Our [data managment SOP](https://rawgit.com/OHI-Science/ohiprep/master/src/dataOrganization_SOP.html) describes how we manage OHI global data, including a description of the file structure used here.  The most current year represents the best available data and methods, and previous years are maintained for archival purposes.  

Please see our [citation policy](http://ohi-science.org/citation-policy/) if you use OHI data or methods.

See our [website](http://ohi-science.org/) for more information about the Ocean Health Index.
