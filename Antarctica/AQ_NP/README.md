### Antarctica NP data

### Data are located in FIS goal ###

This is based on the Krill data (KRI, Euphausia superba)

# The catch data

Volume 27 CCAMLR 2015 Statistical Bulletin

Notes: Season year are used

# The Catch limit data:

We use the combined catch limit for the area 48 regions.  

For Division 58.4.2 we use the "trigger limit" in the "Conservation Measure 51-03.pdf"
rather than the catch limit in the table because that is consistent with what was used in the 48 regions.
