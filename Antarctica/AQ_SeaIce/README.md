## Sea Ice data 

## old
Originally, we used NSIDC data, but we updated to using Sea Ice Season Length data. 

I am keeping these data/code in "old" folder because it is still used to generate extent data.  

Also, it might be useful in the future.  

Corresponding tmp and raw data files are located here (on Neptune due to their large size):  
  Neptune: model/GL-AQ-SeaIce_v2014/SampleSeaIce

## v2015 data
New data is based on Sea Ice Season (days)

I received these data from: jrheuban@whoi.edu  (Jennie Rheuban) and sdoney@whoi.edu (Scott Doney)

A pressure file (hd_sea_ice.csv) is generated by running the toolbox.  Currently, the file is saved in the layers folder,
and I move it to the current assessment year folder.  There is probably a smoother way of doing this, but I'm not sure
what it is yet.
